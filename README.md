Summer, also known as the pre-monsoon season, runs from March through May. April and the beginning of May are the hottest months in western and southern India, whereas May is the hottest month in northern India. Temperatures in the interior range from 32 to 40 degrees Celsius (90 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit) in May. During the month of March, India's summer season is bearable. However, as the season progresses through May and June, we can expect the scorching heat to touch our homes every day between 8 and 10 a.m. We rarely find ourselves in a pleasant atmosphere.
Summers in India are sweltering, with searing temperatures in all sections of the country. The blowing of a scorching wind known as loo is another element of the Indian summer. And, as if it couldn't get any worse, the summer days are longer, and the nights are shorter! 
Everything aside people want to enjoy and relax in summer, but they need a good place/city for vacation. So, here through our project we would be finding the best cities to live in summer based on temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, dew, cloud cover, visibility, windspeed, sea level, pressure of twelve (12) major cities in India.
Keywords: Summer, temperature, best cities, change in temperature over years.
